### Assignment 1
Implemented the *insert* and *search* module of R-Tree for various dimensions of data and report a comparative analysis. 
The implementation follows the algorithm proposed in the paper ["R-Tree: A Dynamic Indexing Structure for Spatial Searching"](http://www-db.deis.unibo.it/courses/SI-LS/papers/Gut84.pdf)


### Assignment 2
Implemented *k-Nearest Neighbour* search algorithm for R-Trees. It first creates an R-Tree for a set of points, and then uses the algorithm proposed in the paper ["Nearest Neighbor Queries"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/223784.223794) to retrieve `k` nearest neighbours.
